# Welcome to Studentenes Kameraklubb's GitHub!
Studentenes Kameraklubb (SK) serves as a focal point for students in Trondheim who share a common interest in photography. With a proud history dating back to 1938, we aim to provide a friendly environment where photography enthusiasts can explore and cultivate their passion for the art of photography.

Our facilities are located at Moholt student village, where we open our doors to our members. Here on GitHub, you will find the code for our website. We appreciate and value all contributions to the project, and we encourage our members to actively participate in the development of the website.

Sincerly,
